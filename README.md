tvOS Client for Twitch.tv

This is an open-source personal project, to learn tvOS. The app consumes the TwitchTV API and brings game, channel and video listings to the TV, as well as allowing consumption of live and archived videos.

No infringment is intended of the Twitch brand or service. This project was purely intended for educational purposes.

More information about this project is available at http://jeon.com.au/twitchy

A video of this project in action is available here: https://vimeo.com/162956789
