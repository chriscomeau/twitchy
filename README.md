tvOS Client for Twitch.tv

This is an open-source personal project, to learn tvOS. The app consumes the TwitchTV API and brings game, channel and video listings to the TV, as well as allowing consumption of live and archived videos.

No infringment is intended of the Twitch brand or service. This project was purely intended for educational purposes.

More information about this project is available at http://jeon.com.au/twitchy

A video of this project in action is available here: https://vimeo.com/162956789

Note, if you wish to compile this project yourself, you will need to create a header file called "TwitchAPIKeys.h" which contains two defines, kAPIClientID and kAPIClientSecret. You will receive these two values when registering a new application on the Twitch.tv site at https://www.twitch.tv/kraken/oauth2/clients/new
